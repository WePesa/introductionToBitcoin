# Introduction to Bitcoin

This document aims to introduce Bitcoin to users without a technical background. It should be easy to read and discusses what is Bitcoin, some potential applications and a basic usage example.

It is recommended as a first read for users that want to know more. I found the need to create this introduction after requests from members of the local meetups what I run. The material is based on the Bitcoin introductory slides that I give frequently.
